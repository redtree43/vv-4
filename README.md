* Problem
    * Vintage clothing (i.e. pre 1980's pieces) have experienced a resurgence in popularity around the world over the last decade. Vintage clothing stocks and styles are distributed globally with different styles being popular in different locations. While brick and mortar clothing stores are common, the ecommerce presence of vintage stores is low with most options only selling vintage through consignment. 
* Solution
    * My marketplace will allow vintage buyers and sellers to connect online to sell and purchase clothing.
